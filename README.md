##Getting and Cleaning Data programming assignment
Repository for programming assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data on Coursera

The files in this repository are as follows:
- README.md : This file
- CodeBook.md : Code book for the programming assingment
- run_analysis.R : Script developed as part of the programming assignment to produce a tidy data set from source data
- final_tidy_data_dt.txt : The tidy data set produced by run_analysis.R
- download_date.txt : The date the source data was downloaded and used to produce the tidy data set.

The development and test system used is an iMac with 8GB RAM running OS X 10.10.2 and RStudio 0.98.1091.

In order to produce the tidy data set, download the file run_analysis.R into a directory with sufficient space to hold the source data file (62.6 MB zipped), the source data expanded, and the resulting tidy data set.
